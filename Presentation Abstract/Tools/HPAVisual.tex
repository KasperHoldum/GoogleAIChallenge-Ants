\subsection{HPA Visualizer}
We implemented the hierarchyal pathfinding algorithm [BMS2004] to improve the running time of path finding. HPA will be covered under in section \ref{sec:datastructures}. Due to the involved nature of the implementation of HPA, we decided to make a visualizer for debugging. It shows us the map split into the zones and the transition points for each of the zones, and we may ask for a path from one point to another and have it shown in the visualizer as well. Being able to see the actual path generated is a big help, as the path is likely to not be optimal and being able to clearly see what causes this sub optimality is useful when we will design the path smoothing for HPA. Path smoothing will be covered in section \ref{sec:datastructures}

A screenshot of the visualizer can be seen in the appendix, fig \ref{fig:awesome_image}.
