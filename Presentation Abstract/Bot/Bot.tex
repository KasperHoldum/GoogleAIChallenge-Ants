\section{Solution}
We have identified several key problems in the challenge:
\begin{itemize}
\item Spreading out ants,
\item finding and eating food,
\item attacking enemy hills,
\item and defending own hills.
\end{itemize}
We will discuss each of these problems and our proposed solution in the following sections. Since each turn is limited in time to 500 ms (subject to change) all algorithms and solutions must be designed with this limit in mind. For more complex solutions we have been forced to implement advanced data structures to minimize the running time. The data structures are briefly mentioned section~\ref{sec:datastructures}.
