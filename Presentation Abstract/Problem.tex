\section{Problem Description}
This years Google AI Challenge is called Ants, which is a turn-based AI game. Each turn an ant may move up, down, left or right on the grid-based map. The map is shaped like torus, meaning there are no edges on the map. Maps may include obstacles, which cannot be directly passed. Each player has one or more hills, on which new ants spawn. Additional ants are acquired by collecting food, which is randomly spawned on the map. Ants can attack enemy ants or hills, where only attacking a hill rewards points. The visibility is limited for each player. Each ant provides vision for the player in a constant radius around the ant. There exists several conditions in which the game will end. A few noticable of these are when a certain turn limit is hit, or when all enemy ants are eliminated. The game is won by the player who gathered the most points.

Each turn every bot is given 500ms to do all calculations and issue orders for all its ants. The time limit imposed on all bots greatly alters the problem from finding optimal solutions for each sub problem, which will likely take much longer than the given time limit. Instead we will have to find approximate solutions that are as optimal as possible while staying within the time limit. The most significant problems for the bot are reproduction, exploration, attacking enemy ants/hills and defending hills.
