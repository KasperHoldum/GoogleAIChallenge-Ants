for each food, assign an ant. all ants not assigned go explore with simple direction priority (north, east, south, west if possible - in that order )

pros:
	only a single ant is assigned to each food
	no idle ants
cons:
	the assignment of ants to food is suboptimal
	the exploring algorithm is too stupid. Too many ants moving the same direction instead of spreading out
	ants getting stuck against water terrain and thus being rendered useless until they are assigned food task

improvments:
	fixed: if several foods has the same ant being closest then only one of those foods will be assigned an ant to.
